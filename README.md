# RegEx Blocks

## What it does
RegEx Blocks is an interactive visual interface for building and testing regular expressions. It's great for research professionals or people learning regex.

## How we built it
RegEx Blocks is built with Angular 5 and TypeScript.

## Challenges we ran into
The nested rendering of some elements, and modelling the regular expression.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The only competitor on the market is harder to use than actually writing regex.

## What's next for RegEx Blocks
Sadly, we didn't have enough time to implement all of regex. We would next add full support for extended regex.
It would also be nice to invert the process, pasting in a regex and seeing the block representation.
